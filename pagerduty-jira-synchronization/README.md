# Configure Jira

Sign up and create a project.

Go to [API tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage/api-tokens) and
create API token.

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and edit it. Put your email to
`JIRA_USER_EMAIL`, put the API token to `JIRA_API_TOKEN`, put your
atlassian root URL (e.g. https://username.atlassian.net) to
`JIRA_SERVER_URL`. Put the key of your project to `JIRA_PROJECT_KEY`
(you can find the key in the list of the existing projects).


# AWS configuration

Be sure you have a configured account on Amazon - AWS.

If not done before, register new account on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/). 
Good practice if you will use not root account for deploying the application
After all required steps for creating finished, you need to create new user 
in [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/users). 
Let name it **gwuser**. 

Add admin permissions to the **gwuser** and then login to the AWS Console 
under **gwuser** credentials [AWS Credential page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/security_credentials).
Generate new access key. Download generated file AccessKeys.csv

Get back to the termanal and install _awscli_ utility via

```pip instal awscli ```

After that you can configure aws credential on you machine

```aws configure```

The screen should looks like

```
AWS Access Key ID [None]: AKIAI44QH8DHBEXAMPLE
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: je7MtGbClwBF/2Zp9Utk/h3yCo8nvbEXAMPLEKEY
Default region name [None]: us-east-1
Default output format [None]: text
```


# Deploy serverless application

In order to deploy the application execute the following command:

```
sls deploy
```

The command should output an endpoint URL, for instance:

```
[...]
endpoints:
  ANY - https://oqzgxd0euf.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev
  ANY - https://oqzgxd0euf.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/{proxy+}
[...]

```

Append `/pagerduty-webhook` to the endpoint and use it as an URL for a
PagerDuty webhook.

# Configure PagerDuty webhook

Go to [Extensions](https://atykhonov.pagerduty.com/extensions) page,
click on `New Extension`, select `Generic V2 Webhook`, put into `Name`
some name (e.g. `pjsync`), select an existing PagerDuty service
(create it if it doesn't exist) and input the PagerDuty webhook URL
into `URL` field. Click `Save`.

After this the serverless application should be executed each time
when a new incident is created.
